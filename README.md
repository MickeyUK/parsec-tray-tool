## About the Project

Parsec Tray Tool attempts to bring the arcade experience back to Parsec! It makes it easy to host your room or look for people hosting, as well as other useful features like auto accepting users joining your computer.

The Parsec Tray Tool is not affiliated with Parsec.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Parsec Tray Tool...please do! It is build upon the Tauri framework, and is coded in TypeScript, Rust and Vue. Here is a guide on how to set up a development environment and how to contribute your changes:

1. Start by [forking](https://github.com/MickeyUK/parsec-tray-tool/fork) your own copy of Parsec Tray Tool.

2. Clone your forked repository to your computer somewhere.

3. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development, and installing the following extensions:

* **Tauri** *by Tauri*
* **rust-analyzer** *by The Rust Programming Language*
* **Vue Language Features (Volar)** *by Vue*
* **Live Sass Compiler** *by Ritwick Dey*
* **Better Comments** *by Aaron Bond*

4. To build the application in dev mode, run this in a terminal:
``` 
npm run tauri dev 
```

5. To build the application, run:

```
npm run tauri build
```

6. Commit and push changes to your repository, then put a pull request in:
https://github.com/MickeyUK/parsec-tray-tool/pulls
I will review your changes, and if I'm happy with it, I'll merge with the main build!
